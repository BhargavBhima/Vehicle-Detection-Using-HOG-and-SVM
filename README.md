The Project
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
Dataset - KITTI dataset
